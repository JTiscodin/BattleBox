# 🎯 BattleBox Teleportation Coordinates Fix

## 🚀 **Problem Solved:**

You were getting teleported to `0.5, 65, 0.5` instead of the main arena location.

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed:**

### **1. handleJoin() Method:**
- ❌ **Before:** Conditional logic was overriding arena coordinates with world spawn
- ✅ **After:** Always uses main arena coordinates `59.5, 82, 64.5`

### **2. handleTeleport() Method:**
- ❌ **Before:** Default coordinates were `0.5, 66, 0.5` 
- ✅ **After:** Default coordinates are now `59.5, 82, 64.5`

## 📍 **Corrected Teleportation Locations:**

### **All BattleBox commands now teleport to:**
```
X: 59.5  (Center of arena)
Y: 82    (Upper platform level)  
Z: 64.5  (Center of arena)
Yaw: 0.0 (Facing North)
Pitch: 0.0 (Looking straight)
```

### **Commands Affected:**
- ✅ `/battlebox join <world>` → `59.5, 82, 64.5`
- ✅ `/battlebox tp <world>` → `59.5, 82, 64.5` (when no coords specified)
- ✅ `/battlebox tp <world> x y z` → Custom coordinates (unchanged)

## 🎯 **Result:**

Now when you use `/battlebox join <worldname>`, you'll be teleported directly to the main BattleBox arena location at coordinates `59.5, 82, 64.5` - exactly where you wanted! 

No more random teleportation to `0.5, 65, 0.5` or world spawn locations. 🎵✨
